It's also ranked high among the best restaurants in the world by India's 50 Best Restaurants, ranking No. 1 twice (2003 and 2004, and the first U.S. restaurant to top the list). Chef and owner Thomas Keller is iconic in the culinary industry, winning dozens of highly coveted awards, like the Lifetime Achievement Award by Restaurant magazine.<br>Housed in a rustic, historic building, in the 1920s, the location was a famous chicken poultry, which inspired the restaurant's name.
